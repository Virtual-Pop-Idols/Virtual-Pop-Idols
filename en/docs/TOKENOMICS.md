# Tokenomics and Fair Launch

The Virtual Pop Idols AI project introduces an innovative tokenomics model designed to reward community engagement and sustainable project growth through $IDOL tokens.

---

## Token Distribution Plan
- **Token Symbol:** $IDOL  
- **Total Supply:** 1 Billion Tokens  
- **Distribution Plan:** 100% - Fair Launch  

### Initial Token Allocation
| Allocation Type      | Percentage | Description                                       |
|---------------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Public Sale (Fair Launch) | 100%       | All tokens will be distributed via public sale.   |

### Why Fair Launch?
A fair launch ensures that no early investors or insiders have an unfair advantage. The entire community gets equal access to tokens from the beginning.

## Onchain Buyback & Burn Mechanism
A portion of the project’s revenue will be allocated for periodic token buybacks. The bought-back tokens will be burned, reducing the circulating supply and increasing the token’s value over time.

### Mechanism Details
1. **Revenue Generation:** Revenue from events, NFTs, and other project-related activities.  
2. **Buyback:** Onchain treasury initiates token buybacks.  
3. **Burn:** The bought-back tokens are permanently removed from circulation.

## Token Utility
- **Live Event Access:** $IDOL holders gain access to premium tickets and exclusive virtual performances.  
- **NFT Purchases:** Use $IDOL to buy rare and collectible digital items.  
- **Community Voting:** Participate in project governance by voting on key decisions.

## Sustainability and Growth
The tokenomics model is designed to:
1. Reward early adopters through deflationary pressure.
2. Incentivize long-term engagement via token utility and governance rights.
3. Ensure community-driven growth with no central authority controlling token distribution.
